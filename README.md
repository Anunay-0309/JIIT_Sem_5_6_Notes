# 📚 JIIT Sem 5 & 6 Notes 🧠

---

## 😩 Context No One Asked For:

so basically  
🧍‍♂️ i’m from **JIIT-128 (ECE)** and  
📌 i had **zero seniors to guide me** through electives, projects, or exams  
📉 so i decided to just **throw any notes i had here** for whoever comes next 🙏

## 📁 What’s Inside:

This folder has notes from:
- `ML` 🤖
- `VLSI` ⚡

- `Literature` 📖
